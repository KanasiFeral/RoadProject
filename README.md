RoadProject

The project works with 15 tables. And has a standard set of functions, such as: add / modify / delete / search. However, the project has a number of procedures that make life easier for the user. Procedures for the removal, addition, modification and retrieval of records. For the operation of the procedures, it is sufficient to pass the input parameters and everything will work. In the add-on plan, just add two value arrays, with the table fields and array values, and everything will work!
